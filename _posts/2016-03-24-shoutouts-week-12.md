## Time flies! It's already week 12 and we've got another round of great achievements to share with you all.

Let's kick off this week's shoutout with a warm welcome to our newest First PRs:

We've also got a big shoutout for austinjreilly: [first PR](hoodiehq/hoodie-server-account#93) and [first starter issue created](hoodiehq/hoodie-server-account#122), which was done by [Manit Singh Kalsi](https://github.com/kazekagegaara) as a first PR to Hoodie. Great stuff! 

Thanks to [Christoph](https://github.com/christophwitzko) for continuous deployment & Docker image for [Tracker app](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-app-tracker) & our [Camp tutorial.](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-camp-tutorial)

Patricia hosted Offline Web Apps as part of a Hoodie workshop at [Health Camp.](http://hackinghealth.ca/event/hacking-health-camp/)
Gem, Nick & Gregor did a [Meet the Hoodies](https://ti.to/hoodie/dc-meet-the-hoodies) event in Washington DC. 

[Jay](https://github.com/JayWIlsonJr) started his [first PR](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-server-account/pull/129) during the DC event and found a bug that we missed till now. [Ola](https://github.com/Oladele) did the same and could even [fix the issue](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-server-account/pull/128) while at it.

[Julia](https://github.com/jsimplicio) continued working on our Tracker App and got several pull requests closed in the past week.

[Ransom](https://github.com/ransomw) implemented the accountAdmin.sessions.add(options) API, which will be great for debugging your apps.

[Cecily](https://github.com/skeskali) & [Jenn](https://github.com/renrutnnej) brought as the past TGIF posts :)

[Sean](https://github.com/seanjohnite) found out that Hoodie’s connectionStatus API does not yet have 100% coverage, went ahead and fixed it. So much <3
