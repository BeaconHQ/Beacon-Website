Thank Grohl, Gauss, Glob, Galileo and Science it’s Friday, and again it's time for our weekly reading recommendations, prepared to help you get some good reading time on your weekend. As usually, they're curated for you by [Julia](http://twitter.com/juschm) and [Lena](http://twitter.com/lrnrd). Enjoy!

##Open Source

[io.js 1.0.1 (beta)](https://iojs.org/) is out.

##Design

Underrepresented groups get so few spaces where they are the focus. Spaces where they get to see people like themselves on stage and learn from them. Spaces where people like them are prioritized. Seeing someone from the majority in a position of prominence in that space is demoralizing. It means that yet again the majority is given priority, even in a space that isn’t supposed to be about them. –

We, the profession of software engineering, built the Orwellian future we now inhabit, and it is high time for a retrospective. –

##The Tech World and Culture

The method of classifying people as “similar” reduces us to objects that might be recommended, through data, like a book or kitchen item. –

##The Business

>
Feminists insist that the more women, people of color and LGBT individuals are visible, the better off – and more egalitarian – the world will be. But is simple representation the best answer to sexism? –

A common argument against pushing for greater diversity is that it will lower standards, raising the spectre of a diverse but mediocre group. –

It is possible to hold on so tightly to one another that we smother each other’s potential in our own fears and insecurities. I pray we take each other so seriously we refuse every temptation to do so. –

[…] you should be skeptical whenever you see powerful men arguing for magical future outcomes in regard to diversity. Instead, ask what they can do right now to affect discrimination in their companies. –

##Being human

As much of us reformed Nice Guys™ learn, relationships aren't a game you win, and they only work when you're willing to accept a person as they are, in all their complex mess, and you're willing to offer yourself up exactly as you are, no matter how broken, and let them make the call. –

In an unequal world, satire that mocks everyone serves the powerful. It is worth asking what pre-existing injuries we add our insults to. –

if you’re human, you have bias, and that it impacts almost every variation of human identity: Race, gender, sexual orientation, body size, religion, accent, height, hand dominance, etc. The question is not "do we have bias?" but rather "which are ours?" –
