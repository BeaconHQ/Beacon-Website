*Update July 26:* We&#8217;re incredibly happy about all emails we received and are really glad we now found someone who&#8217;ll be helping us keep the &#8220;TGIF&#8221; alive. <3 If you still want to help us with e.g. design, writing or anything else you can think of and want to become part of our amazing community: ping us, we&#8217;d love to hear from you!

Dear Friends of Hoodie,

We love our weekly &#8220;[TGIF][2]&#8221; and we have heard from many of you, that you also love TGIF. However, after extensive discussions, we had to come to the conclusion that we&#8217;ll have to let our weekly TGIF link collection go on a longer summer vacation. At the moment, our resources are very limited and as such, we won&#8217;t be able to continue collecting, reading content and curating all links for this weekly release on our own. We&#8217;ll extend our Twitter activities a bit and tweet more content aside from directly Hoodie-related items from now on.

We want to thank everyone who has shared those links during the last 35 releases and given us great feedback. We know that there are some of you who have really appreciated this and we want to say a special thanks to you, it&#8217;s been a pleasure working on this content for you. The thing is, for now, we&#8217;ll have to focus more on Hoodie itself and don&#8217;t see any way to keep the TGIF going as well. We&#8217;ll work towards restarting this little series by autumn. Or …

**Do you want to help us?**

Are you interested in

*   the future of the web
*   and what&#8217;s happening in and around it currently
*   design
*   software development and how to do it
*   building sustainable tech businesses
*   feminism

and would want to prepare the &#8220;TGIF!&#8221; either weekly, twice a month or monthly, no matter what works for you? We&#8217;d love to have you on board!

We&#8217;d especially love to encourage people who have not contributed to an Open Source project before, everyone who is not a developer but, for example, a writer, marketing or communications expert or just interested in reading and sharing good content. The &#8220;TGIF!&#8221; mainly focuses on all topics related to Hoodie which are listed above and have also been special sections in our 35 posts we&#8217;ve had so far.

We can also recommend sources and would of course help with getting you started and providing all support you need. And it would of course also be possible to, for example, start with shorter issues or a different frequency than weekly – we&#8217;re happy to talk about this with you.

If this sounds like something you&#8217;d want to do, send us an email to hi\_thehoodiefirm\_com. We&#8217;re looking forward to hearing from you!

Update: ***Thanks so much to everyone who contacted us!* **We&#8217;re very glad we found someone who&#8217;s now helping us with these link collections. If you&#8217;re interested in helping out with other communication parts of Hoodie, please contact us, there&#8217;s a lot to do :)
