Today is a big day for us: we're launching [our very new Hood.ie Website](/).

And we want to say

## Thank you

Thank you to everyone who worked on this, the people who spent endless hours thinking, designing, coding, writing, drawing, giving us feedback and more.

Our special thank you goes to:

- [Ola Gasidlo](/community#ola-gasidlo) and [Kevin Lorenz](/community#kevin-lorenz) – without you two, your endless patience, many nights of coding and overall amazing work, all of this wouldn't have been possible.
- [Alex Feyerke](/community#alex-feyerke) for the help with the design setup, our new [Events page](/events) and the Hoodie Logo animation.
- [Carolina Buzio](/community#carolina-buzio) for the wonderful collaboration and your superb work (see more of the results in the next weeks).
- [Jens Nikolaus](http://twitter.com/jensnikolaus) and [Max Fellmuth](http://twitter.com/maxfell)  for their great help with the initial design ideas.
- [Nick Hehr](http://twitter.com/hipsterbrown) for the Jekyll support when it was urgently needed.
- … and finally to [Lena Reinhard](/community#lena-reinhard) who wrote all content for all pages, took all photos and did the website relaunch project management.
