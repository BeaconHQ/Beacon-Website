## The Web and Development

> Release notes are a really interesting engagement opportunity to me—most people don’t read them, but those that do represent a highly targeted audience of very engaged users. Every company with an app has to write them, and I love to see who treats it like an opportunity instead of a chore. <cite>Adam Sigel, [Great Release Notes](http://www.adamdsigel.com/2015/04/15/great-release-notes/)</cite>



## The Tech World and Culture

> Why are rock stars so common and successful? There’s something deep inside the human psyche that loves rock stars and narcissists. We easily fall under their spell unless we carefully train ourselves to detect them. Narcissists are skilled at making good first impressions, at masking abusive behavior as merely eccentric or entertaining, at taking credit for others’ work, at fitting our (often inaccurate) stereotypes of leaders as self-centered, self-aggrandizing, and overly confident. We tend to confuse confidence with competence, and narcissists are skilled at acting confident.<cite>Leigh Honeywell, [No more rock stars: how to stop abuse in tech communities](https://hypatia.ca/2016/06/21/no-more-rock-stars/)</cite>

## The Business

> It used to be tough to easily send personalized messages, but dynamic content is changing the game. Dynamic content makes it easy to swap in different copy or imagery based on the subscriber. You don’t have to know how to code to send these messages.<cite>[7 Ways to Up Your Email Marketing](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2016/06/7-ways-up-your-email-marketing-game/), Campaign Monitor</cite>
