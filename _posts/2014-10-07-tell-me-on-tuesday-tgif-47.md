Thank Grohl, Gauss, Glob, Galileo and Science it’s … well, not Friday this time. But, hey, it’s Tuesday, this is also a good day, and we really hope you’re having a great week so far. To make it even a bit better, here are our reading recommendations, curated for you by [Julia](http://twitter.com/juschm) and [Lena](http://twitter.com/lrnrd), for your <del>weekend or a</del> lazy afternoon. Enjoy!

## Open Source

[Open Standard or Open Source? Or both?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNPNpBQuh40)

## The Web and Development

It needs a good partner, but [here are some pros of pair programming](https://medium.com/web-design-and-development/the-power-of-pair-programming-vulcan-mind-melding-fa4718130bfe) in case you need some more reasons to finally try it.

## The tech world and culture

> In the past I’ve had hectic speaking seasons (why is September such a pain?), but doing this all with a jolly but demanding little accomplice in tow added a whole new dimension.

> But get to know someone from a marginalized background who also works in tech. Ask them privately what they think of Hacker News—as I have in preparing this post.

## The business

Of course, investing is important, but if you remember what overspending did to the economy, [spending less than you make](http://austinkleon.com/2013/08/01/keep-your-overhead-low/) seems like the most sensible advise to any business person.
