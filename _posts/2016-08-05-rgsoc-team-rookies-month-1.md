Hi, we’re Tehetena and HyeSoo. We are happy to write about our 2016 summer experience with the Hoodie project. We met Hoodie with Rails Girls summer of Code. We joined the Rails Girls summer of Code as a team ‘Rookies’. It has been an amazing experience, since we have started working on the Hoodie desktop application project.

When we started the project, we had low self confidence. Even though we have taken classes on different programming languages, but when it comes to working with it we always thought that we did not have all the knowledge it took to get the job done. Now we have understood that every working experience is a great opportunity to teach ourselves new things everyday.

The very first lesson we learned was Git. We have done several school projects that we have managed to save and clone project repositories on Git, but after we have started working on the Hoodie desktop application, there have been many challenges. At first, we did not know how to propose issues, pull request, fetch from remote, rebase and so on, and we were confused with the concept between local and remote. With our mentor Gregor’s help and many trials & errors, we now have better understanding of how the Github actually works and how it is used in our project and also when many contributors are working on the same project.

Other than using Github, we have also learned a lot on UI building and how to implement functionalities on the application, using HTML, CSS and Javascript. We learned how to use event listener, event target, .map, .forEach and localStorage. Especially, using localStorage and making API were very interesting. We followed the tutorials which were made by Gregor.(Link: https://github.com/gr2m/localstorage-tutorial/) It was very helpful and easy to follow. After practicing the code with tutorials, we had a call to solve the problems together and had a Q&A session. We have a call almost everyday. It’s been really helpful and given us deeper insight on how coding can be applied in the application and how we can use it in the desktop application with Electron framework.

Sometimes there were certain problems which took longer time to solve, but working with advanced coaches and mentors taught us different ways to solve them, and most of the times the new approaches were even easier and clearer to understand. The mentors and coaches’ guidance helped us experiment on different coding practices we came across online. It also ensured us that there was someone whom we could rely on and ask questions.  

Lastly, we would like to share one happy news with Hoodie community. A newborn baby joined our journey. HyeSoo delivered a baby just 3 weeks ago. We hope that the baby can bring happiness to our project and our team. We also hope that we can make a useful Hoodie desktop application for the users. Thank you for welcoming us and providing us a wonderful chance to join Hoodie project.  Happy Summer & happy coding! ;D
