“This change is a reflection of preferences within our community, as well as an acknowledgement of our position in an increasingly interconnected world. Encouraging free and open source software realigns our policies with our mission. As an academic institution, we believe that in many cases we can achieve greater impact by sharing our work.”

## The Business
  
“It started out as a simple challenge: could he meet one new coworker each workday for an entire month? One person. Every day. Couldn’t be that hard, right?

He tracked everything in a spreadsheet, with a person’s name, their department, and that one fact.”
