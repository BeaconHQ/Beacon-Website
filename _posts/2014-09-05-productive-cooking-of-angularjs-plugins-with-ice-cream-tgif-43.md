<em>Thank Grohl, Gauss, Glob, Galileo and Science it’s Friday! The week’s (almost) over, and these are our reading recommendations, curated for you by Julia and Lena, for your weekend or a lazy afternoon. Enjoy!</em>

**Open Source**

On the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE-JbJ5Ues8">business value of open source</a>: <em>&#8220;If you said 20 years ago, that there would be this huge thing and everybody would work for free and they would give things away for free, you wouldn&#8217;t have believed it.&#8221;</em>

Sascha Brink is writing an <a href="https://leanpub.com/angularjs-cookbook">AngularJS Cookbook</a> to help you speed up your work process when using the framework. 85 percent are already done and ready to be read and you yourself decide, what you want to pay.

Our amazing Hoodie-Community-Member <a href="http://twitter.com/boennemann">Stephan</a> wrote a <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-semantic-release">grunt-semantic-release plugin</a> this week, and you should check it out (you can also find it <a href="https://github.com/boennemann/grunt-semantic-release">on GitHub)</a>.

  The behaviour of some readers while commenting on articles about women&#8217;s issues makes some editors wonder, whether online anonymity should be <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/10/readers-editor-online-abuse-women-issues">an option rather than the default</a>.

  <em>&#8220;The problem with &#8216;I’m entitled to my opinion&#8217; is that, all too often, it’s used to shelter beliefs that should have been abandoned. It becomes shorthand for &#8216;I can say or think whatever I like&#8217; – and by extension, continuing to argue is somehow disrespectful.&#8221;</em> – <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/brain/no-youre-not-entitled-your-opinion">No, you&#8217;re not entitled to your opinion</a>

  <em><span class="anno-span">&#8220;Somebody who is good for your team is not necessarily somebody you want to be friends with.
