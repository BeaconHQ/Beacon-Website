<a href="http://2014.jsunconf.eu/images/logo.png" rel="lightbox[1380]" title="Team Hoodie gives away two tickets for JSUnconf EU"><img class="alignright" alt="" src="http://2014.jsunconf.eu/images/logo.png" width="133" height="133" /></a>On April 26-27 [JS Unconf][1] in Hamburg will take place for the very first time. It is an [Un-Conference][2] that is run by the attendees for the attendees. Based on the current state of [submissions and talk interests][3], it is going to be great. And the best thing is: you can be an attendee! – Team Hoodie is giving away **two** tickets to JSUnConf EU \o/

**Here&#8217;s the deal:**
We gift two of you great people out there:
&#8211; One ticket to the conference
&#8211; Travel expenses of up to 100€
All you need is find a place to stay. We can help reaching out to people for you.

We&#8217;d like to give this package especially to people who otherwise couldn&#8217;t make it to the conference. You don&#8217;t have to explain your personal situation to us (but you can of course, if you want to). We trust you in this point anyway :)

**To win**, please send us an email to hi@thehoodiefirm.com and answer the following questions:
&#8211; Who are you?
&#8211; What do you do?
&#8211; Why should you win a ticket?
Team Hoodie will elect the two winners we’ll announce them by Friday, April 18th, in this post and via personal email to the winners.

Looking forward to hearing from you! And, by the way: going to JS Unconf is also your chance to meet [Ola][4] who will also attend :)
