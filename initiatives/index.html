            <p>We love Hoodie, and working on this project has had huge impact and made a big change for everyone of us individually. <strong>Hoodie has made us think about the web, the way we build it and where we want it to go in the future</strong>, and Hoodie aligns with initiatives which are now as well part of it as Hoodie is part of them. The work on Hoodie also <strong>inspired us to build tools</strong> which we’re now using to <strong>coordinate our work on it</strong> – to stay in touch with our community, attract new contributors and give everyone interested an overview of what we’re doing. All of these initiatives and tools have become near and dear to us as individuals, and they’re now also an important part of Hoodie.</p>

            <p><strong>We live in a disconnected and battery powered world</strong>, but our technology and best practices are a leftover from the always connected & steadily powered past. We can’t keep building apps with the desktop mindset of permanent, fast connectivity in mind, where a <strong>temporary disconnection</strong> or slow service is regarded as a problem and <strong>communicated to the user as an error</strong>. Instead, we need to <strong>embrace being offline as a recurring state</strong> and offer UI, UX and architecture solutions that are built with this mindset.</p>
            <p>Started in November 2013 with <a href="http://blog.hood.ie/2013/11/say-hello-to-offline-first" target="_blank">this blog post</a>, this initiative aims to start a discussion about mobile and offline first app development that goes <strong>beyond shrinking content to</strong> phone and tablet <strong>screen sizes</strong>.</p>
            <p>Started in November 2013 with <a href="http://blog.hood.ie/2013/11/say-hello-to-offline-first" target="_blank">this blog post</a>, this initiative aims to start a discussion about mobile and offline first app development that goes <strong>beyond shrinking content to</strong> phone and tablet <strong>screen sizes</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Offline First is built into Hoodie by default</strong>: Hoodie’s API decouples the client and the server in the store process so it can get interrupted or stop at any stage without breaking. Thus, <strong>users can keep working without interruption and without having to fear data loss</strong>.</p>
            <p>It enables you to <strong>build incredibly fast apps with zero latency</strong> and better apps with <strong>higher conversion rates</strong>.</p>

            <p>There was a time when app development was dictated by the backend - when building any application was almost entirely impossible without thinking (and, yes, sometimes worrying) about its backend. <strong>noBackend</strong> is an initiative that <strong>aims to enable everyone to turn smart ideas into elegant apps</strong>, without being torn apart by worrying about backends.</p>
            <p>noBackend doesn’t actually mean that there is no backend. It means that <strong>you don't have to deal with the backend because it is abstracted away</strong> and backend services can be accessed and used via the <strong>JavaScript API</strong>.</p>
            <p>This allows <strong>frontend developers</strong> to <strong>focus on user experience</strong> and gives <strong>backend developers more flexibility on the implementation side</strong>. It ultimately leads to backends that can be used out of the box, like <a href="/">Hoodie</a>, <a href="http://remotestorage.io" target="_blank">remoteStorage</a> or <a href="https://www.firebase.com" target="_blank">Firebase</a>, empowering frontend developers to build entire apps without even thinking about backend at all.</p>

            <p>The core of Open Source Software projects is usually code, and work on community expansion and attracting new contributors has most often been a synonym for getting new developers on board. Still, there’s so <strong>much more that can be done</strong> in Open Source: starting with <a href="/contribute#documentation">writing documentation</a>, submitting <a href="/bug">bug reports</a>, <a href="/contribute#content">writing content for a website or blog</a> to <a href="/contribute#design">design</a>, <a href="/contribute#meetups">event organisation</a> and much more. This small initiative, started off with two blog posts about the <a href="http://blog.hood.ie/2014/02/non-coders-in-open-source-projects-or-on-aliens-confessions-of-a-non-coder-1">relevance of non-coders in Open Source</a> and <a href="http://blog.hood.ie/2014/02/confessions-of-an-alien-or-the-ultimate-guide-to-attracting-non-coding-contributors-to-your-open-source-project-2/">how to attract them</a>, aims to <strong>raise awareness</strong> for the relevance of non-coders and <strong>give practical advice</strong> on how to attract and keep them happy in these projects.</p>

            <p>Hoodie’s API is Dreamcode, and this means: its API is optimized for being awesom. It’s <strong>optimized for making the lives of frontend developers as good and easy as possible</strong> by providing well-understandable and -readable code. Essentially, Dreamcode means that you dream up the code you would <em>like</em> to write, and work backwards from there. Thus, Hoodie’s code is easy to write and easy to read. <strong>It’s the code of your dreams!</strong></p>
            <p>Hoodie is also an API first: it’s a promise. This is what makes <a href="/initiatives#nobackend">noBackend</a> possible. Everything else like Hoodie’s implementation may change and improve over time, but <strong>the interface provided to developers will always remain the same</strong>, so that you won’t ever have to worry about it.</p>

                This GitHub-API-backed Milestone app was born in a time of slight confusion: we knew there was so much to do, we knew we had too little time, and we knew we wanted to get things done. But we didn’t know where to start. Thus, over one weekend, we built this app. It shows <strong>an overview of the Hoodie Roadmap</strong> – all features we want to build, what we want to deliver the community and what it will enable people to do. It’s quite high-level, but it <strong>helps us</strong> a lot <strong>keep track of Hoodie’s progress</strong> on a daily basis, see what everyone is working on, which to dos we can point out to prospective contributors and give an impression to Hoodie’s progress to everyone.

                A collective team hack on a sunny thursday afternoon, based on the idea of <strong>showing all recent accomplishments</strong> and <strong>open to dos</strong> in one interface: this is <a href="http://espy.github.io/ubersicht/#hoodiehq" target="_blank">Ubersicht</a>. We built it to give people a place to go when they just wanted to code on something, including the option to <strong>filter the items</strong> based on their individual skills and needs.
