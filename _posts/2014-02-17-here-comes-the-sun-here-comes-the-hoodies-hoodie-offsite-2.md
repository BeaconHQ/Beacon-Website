<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>The year is 2014. Europe is entirely occupied by Winter. </em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>Well, not entirely &#8230; </em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img alt="201419_2446" src="/dist/blog/2014/02/201419_2446-705x470.jpg" width="705" height="470" />

  <em><!--more-->One small island in the Atlantic Ocean still holds out against the cold. And seven people, armed with laptops, whiteboards and post-its, have arrived: to fight the wind, to embrace the sun, and to bring their beloved project further along &#8230;</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <img alt="201419_0313" src="/dist/blog/2014/02/201419_0313-705x470.jpg" width="705" height="470" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Hoodie is still manufactured by a remotely-working team. Thus, these offsites are very important for us: they&#8217;re the only time in the year when we all meet in person.
</p>

<img alt="201419_1518" src="/dist/blog/2014/02/201419_1518-313x470.jpg" width="313" height="470" /> <img alt="201419_1949-Edit" src="http://blog.hood.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/201419_1949-Edit-313x470.jpg" width="313" height="470" /> <img alt="201419_1116" src="http://blog.hood.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/201419_1116-313x470.jpg" width="313" height="470" /> <img alt="201419_2002-2" src="http://blog.hood.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/201419_2002-2-313x470.jpg" width="313" height="470" /> <p style="text-align: center;">
  And like <a href="http://blog.hood.ie/2013/07/people-time-and-a-room-with-a-view-developing-hoodie-further/">last time</a>, we had a fantastic time together. But we were even more productive than during offsite number one.
</p>

<img alt="201419_1234" src="/dist/blog/2014/02/201419_1234-313x470.jpg" width="313" height="470" /> <img alt="201419_1984" src="http://blog.hood.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/201419_1984-313x470.jpg" width="313" height="470" /> <p style="text-align: center;">
  After everyone had landed safely, we took a look around our house and did the first shopping tour (one of many to follow &#8211; you won&#8217;t believe how much food and water seven people need). The next morning, we sat together after breakfast and decided to try out another system for timeboxing: <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">pomodoros</a>. We talked about the topics we already had collected the weeks before, decided who would join the debates and development rounds and which deliverables we&#8217;d aim for, wrote everything on post-its, sticked them to our wall and gave it a go.
</p>

<img alt="201419_0357" src="/dist/blog/2014/02/201419_0357-705x470.jpg" width="705" height="470" /> <p style="text-align: center;">
  And, wow, we did a lot. We started and finished our work on 24 main- and 20 subtopics, some of them one, others two or three pomodoros.
</p>

<img alt="201419_0388" src="/dist/blog/2014/02/201419_0388-705x470.jpg" width="705" height="470" /> <p style="text-align: center;">
  On some of them, we worked on in smaller groups of 2-4, others were discussed by the entire team sitting on our terrace looking at the sea (and our notebooks on the table).
</p>

<img alt="201419_0400" src="/dist/blog/2014/02/201419_0400-705x470.jpg" width="705" height="470" /> <p style="text-align: center;">
  Others were good for a discussion with everyone sitting on the couch in the evening, having a can of ginger beer. And some could even be gotten done during board meetings &#8211; in the pool.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>&#8220;It’s not allowed to work after swimming.&#8221;</em> — <em>&#8220;That’s why I went into the pool so early.&#8221;</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Well, and besides, we shipped an entire app. After GitHub&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/blog/1763-better-organizations">announcement</a> of better organizations, we spent an afternoon building an app for an even better view over organizations&#8217; activities: the birth of <a href="https://github.com/espy/ubersicht">Ubersicht</a>.
</p>

<img alt="201419_1917" src="/dist/blog/2014/02/201419_1917-705x470.jpg" width="705" height="470" /> <p style="text-align: center;">
  And we talked a lot. This time, we were seven people (last time just five), so it was a good time to get to know especially our new team members better. When you&#8217;re used to working without the presence of other people, it&#8217;s a very new feeling to just see them all day, (almost) all night. An amazing one, if you ask me.
</p>

  <em>&#8220;This won&#8217;t look good.&#8221; – &#8220;HackerNews doesn&#8217;t look good either!&#8221;</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  We had again reserved some time for the fun parts: playing beachvolleyball (it <em>was</em> beachvolleyball, even though it didn&#8217;t always look like).
</p>

  Discussing which island(s) we could see from our terrace (spoiler: Fuerteventura it was).

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Hiding from the wind (and the bright sunlight).

  And, as last time, there was lots of &#8220;me-time&#8221; for everyone.
</p>

<img alt="201419_0316-Edit" src="/dist/blog/2014/02/201419_0316-Edit-705x470.jpg" width="705" height="470" /> <p style="text-align: center;">
  This time we often used for just having some time alone.
</p>

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1095" alt="201419_0623" src="/dist/blog/2014/02/201419_0623-705x470.jpg" width="705" height="470" /> <p style="text-align: center;">
  And, of course, there was lots of hacking time.
</p>

<img alt="201419_2012" src="/dist/blog/2014/02/201419_2012-705x470.jpg" width="705" height="470" /> <p style="text-align: center;">

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>“Can you invite me?” – “I don’t know. Can we trust you?”</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  So, <strong>which impact did Offsite number two have on Hoodie as a project?</strong>
</p>

<img alt="201419_2006" src="/dist/blog/2014/02/201419_2006-705x470.jpg" width="705" height="470" /> <p style="text-align: center;">
  First, of course, it brought the team much closer together.
</p>

<img alt="201419_1923-2" src="/dist/blog/2014/02/201419_1923-2-313x470.jpg" width="313" height="470" /> <img alt="201419_1908" src="http://blog.hood.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/201419_1908-313x470.jpg" width="313" height="470" /> <p style="text-align: center;">
  It was a very good time to define the project&#8217;s and each member&#8217;s personal goals.
</p>

<img alt="201419_1252" src="/dist/blog/2014/02/201419_1252-705x470.jpg" width="705" height="470" /> <p style="text-align: center;">
  A time for heart-to-heart talk, having coffee together in the hammock and bringing up new ideas while laying besides the pool or walking along the beach.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <img alt="201419_1501" src="/dist/blog/2014/02/201419_1501-313x470.jpg" width="313" height="470" /> <img alt="201419_1159" src="http://blog.hood.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/201419_1159-313x470.jpg" width="313" height="470" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
   As experienced during last offsite, this week spent together usually has a long-lasting impact on the way we collaborate &#8211; it takes us closer together as a team, and reminds us of why we&#8217;re all working on this project (and how). It helps us set priorities, both personally and as a team, and thus this time can&#8217;t be valued enough.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>&#8220;Where’s it hosted?&#8221; – &#8220;In Sheffield.&#8221;</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  The second, very important thing is that we shipped <em>a lot</em>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img alt="201419_2400" src="/dist/blog/2014/02/201419_2400-705x470.jpg" width="705" height="470" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Especially very complex topics or those which are about philosophy and long-term ideas and impact, are often easier when discussed in person. There&#8217;s always a huge impact on this side of our offsites&#8217; effects, because it leads not only to new repos, issues and commits, but also to an update of Hoodie&#8217;s &#8220;big picture&#8221; and all those small steps leading to it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  The first measurable impact of all this will be published in the next months &#8211; and there&#8217;s a lot more things to come.
</p>

<img alt="201419_0344" src="/dist/blog/2014/02/201419_0344-313x470.jpg" width="313" height="470" /> <img alt="201419_2109" src="http://blog.hood.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/201419_2109-313x470.jpg" width="313" height="470" /> <p style="text-align: center;">
  We still got a long way to go.<br /> And we&#8217;re very much looking forward to going it with you.
