TGIF! ‚Äì Thank Grohl, Gauss, Glob, Galileo and Science it‚Äôs Friday, and again it‚Äôs time for our weekly reading recommendations, prepared to help you get some good reading time on your weekend. As usual, they‚Äôre curated for you by [Cecily](http://twitter.com/skeskali). Enjoy!

## Shout outs üì£

Starting with our favourite: welcome to our new contributors Alex ([Github](https://github.com/alexeyzab)), Aline ([GitHub](https://github.com/AlineBastos), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlineBastos)), Ali ([GitHub](https://github.com/alisabzevari), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alisabzevari)), Antoine ([GitHub](https://github.com/antoinelyset), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/antoinelyset)), austinjreilly ([GitHub](https://github.com/austinjreilly)), Bart ([GitHub](https://github.com/bartw), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BartWijnants)), Eder ([GitHub](https://github.com/ederribeiro), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ApuSoft)), Sean ([GitHub](https://github.com/seanjohnite), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/seanjohnite))

Thanks to Christoph ([GitHub](https://github.com/christophwitzko), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/christophwitzko)), you can play with the new Hoodie Camp Release without the need to install CouchDB first. That makes Hoodie only an *npm install* away üòª To give it a spin, [here are the setup instructions](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-app-tracker/tree/tent-pouchdb#setup)

Our two favourites Nicks ([1](https://github.com/hipsterbrown), [2](https://github.com/nickcolley)) do an outstanding job as part of Hoodie‚Äôs maintainers team to review new Pull Requests and help people contributing in many ways, both on GitHub and our [Hoodie Chat](http://hood.ie/chat/). While at it, shout out to [LGTM.co](https://lgtm.co/) ‚Äì it integrates nicely with GitHub and makes sure we don‚Äôt merge anything without at least two reviews from our maintainers. Check it out :)

Thanks to Charlotte ([GitHub](https://github.com/charlotteis), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/charlotteis)), Jan ([GitHub](https://github.com/janl), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/janl)), Jenn ([GitHub](https://github.com/renrutnnej), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jennwrites)), Jules ([GitHub](https://github.com/jo-porter), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ExactlyJ)) on their amazing editorial work.

## Design

> As different perspectives are brought to the table, a greater understanding can be realized. It is important to me as a black designer to look for ways that my unique cultural experience can add value to a project. No one else can tell our stories but us; therefore, we should not discount the advantages that we hold that can change the world.

## The Web and Development

>In just under a decade, changes in China, corporate interest in preparing the ‚Äúnext billion‚Äù workforce and a cultural shift in how we compute (small-serving) has taken ‚Äúmaking‚Äù mainstream. But mostly as a meme. As Make author and editor Alasdair Allan puts it, makers are in a ‚Äútrough of disillusionment.‚Äù It should be ‚Äúabout more than electronics,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúit‚Äôs supposed to be a cultural movement.‚Äù

## The Tech World and Culture

>I tell you the story of how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time in my entire life that I had done something that was truly brave, where I didn‚Äôt worry about being perfect.

>What happens when we don‚Äôt have a culture of self-criticism? Well, we can probably guess from every single other industry that got too full of itself: We‚Äôre on a path where we will no longer be seen as ‚Äúthe good guys‚Äù unless we make serious, meaningful changes. (And yeah, we‚Äôre especially not gonna be seen as ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù if ‚Äúguys‚Äù stay in place as the overwhelmingly dominant force in the industry.)

## Become a Hoodie Contributor ‚Äî Editorial Edition

As Jenn wrote in her recent post on [Shaping an open source editorial team](http://hood.ie/blog/shaping-an-open-source-editorial-team.html), any issues with the **help wanted** and **ready** labels on our [Editorial GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+label%3Aready) are ready for you to become a Hoodie Contributor :)

Hoodie relies on many other projects, and we would love talk about them: [https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues/25](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues/25)

On of our favourite projects is PouchDB, and they asked us to add Hoodie to their list of users: [https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues/72](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues/72)

We are thinking about how to create a better experience for new and existing contributors, no matter what kind of contribution: [https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues/61](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues/61)

Gregor would like to create a tutorial on how to give the new Hoodie Camp Release a try. Want to help him out? [https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues/71](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues/71)

## Hoodie Camp Release üèï

Thanks to Christoph‚Äôs ([GitHub](https://github.com/christophwitzko), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/christophwitzko) aforementioned Work, you can play with the new Hoodie Camp Release without the need to install CouchDB. To give it a spin, [here are the setup instructions](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-app-tracker/tree/tent-pouchdb#setup). Just to be clear, Hoodie will always work with CouchDB and we recommend to use it in production.

We renamed the *www/* folder to *public/* ([Discussion](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-server/issues/436)) and we renamed */hoodie/bundle.js* to */hoodie/client.js* ([Discussion](https://github.com/hoodiehq/discussion/issues/89)).
