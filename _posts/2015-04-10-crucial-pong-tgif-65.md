##The Tech World and Culture

Somehow, I became a weapon to be used against trolls, a target for trolls to abuse, and in both cases, less of a person. Somehow, somehow, somehow. I’m learning to be OK with this. I’m trying. It’s hard. It sucks. I’m tired. I’m angry. I’m hurt. Every mean comment hurts. But I can’t think about it, and I have to keep moving, because I won’t accept violent or sexual threats as being acceptable. I won’t ever accept having to plan for being SWATed as part of being an woman that is opinionated, playing video games, or working in a male dominated industry. <cite>[Tales from the Trenches: I was SWATed](http://blog.randi.io/2015/04/03/swated/)</cite>
