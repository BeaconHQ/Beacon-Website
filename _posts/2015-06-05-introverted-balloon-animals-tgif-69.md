##The Web and Development

> As I hear stories about teams using a microservices architecture, I've noticed a common pattern. 1) Almost all the successful microservice stories have started with a monolith that got too big and was broken up. 2) Almost all the cases where I've heard of a system that was built as a microservice system from scratch, it has ended up in serious trouble. <cite>[MonolithFirst](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html)</cite>

##The Tech World and Culture

> If you ever played The Sims, you’ll remember that each Sim had a social meter, and if the Sim went too long without seeing another Sim, it would get more and more red and they’d get really cranky and exhausted and probably catch on fire. I’m like that, except instead of people time, I get cranky without alone time. Now this isn’t to say that I don’t enjoy meeting new people at conferences, or seeing old Twitter friends in person. But I have to do it in small doses. <cite>[On conferencing while introverted](http://beero.ps/2015/05/31/on-conferencing-while-introverted/)</cite>

> We've been in the New York Times and been invited to conferences and told that we are Important Voices, doing Important Work, we've been on the news at night and in magazines. We are awash in social capital. But none of it translates to real capital. <cite>[All the women I know in video games are tired](http://boingboing.net/2015/05/29/all-the-women-i-know-in-video.html)</cite>

> When told not to worry about something, that isn't actually an option.  Logically I may know that it's not worth worrying about, but that doesn't change my feelings. Embellishing on this point - there is no logic. <cite>[
