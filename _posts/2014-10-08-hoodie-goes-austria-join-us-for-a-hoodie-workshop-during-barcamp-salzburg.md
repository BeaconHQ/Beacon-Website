Twice a year, the University of Applied Sciences in Salzburg hosts a Barcamp. A [Barcamp][2] is an un-conference: there&#8217;s no fixed schedule, all sessions and topics are discussed when all attendees are there and everyone has the chance to bring themselves and their ideas in.

From **October 24-26**, this Barcamp will take place [in Salzburg for the 7th time][1]. The range of topics in the past years covered (almost) everything from JavaScript to Ruby on Rails, Perl and PHP; from test-driven development to usability, from Greenpeace to Firefox OS. The audience included people from various industries, NGOs, as well as the university. [Registration and Tickets][3] for the Barcamp are free (you should only register so the organizers can plan accordingly).

The **schedule** for the 3-days-event includes: talks and a small project presentation on *Friday*; talks and workshops on *Saturday*; and a speakers&#8217; retreat with food for all speakers on *Sunday*. Although most sessions may be in German, people are encouraged to give their talks in English.

And this time, we&#8217;re up to something special.

At Barcamp Salzburg, [Jan-Erik][4] and [Lena][5] will be hosting a **[Hoodie-Workshop][6] on Saturday**. We&#8217;ll start by discussing with you which kinds of apps you want to develop, either on your own or in small teams, go on with setting up Hoodie together with you and then help you develop your very own Hoodie-based app. During the workshop, we&#8217;ll be there to answer your questions and help you when something is blocking you. All learning materials for the Workshop will be in English, so if you don&#8217;t speak German but want to attend: join us!

The workshop mainly targets** frontend developers **and** designers with frontend development skills** and we&#8217;d love to meet you there. The workshop is free, there&#8217;s only a registration fee of 5â‚¬ which will be returned to you when you attend the workshop. Sign up for the workshop [here][7], we hope to meet you there! :)

Tickets for the Barcamp itself are available [here][3].

See you in Salzburg!
