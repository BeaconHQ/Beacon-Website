        </h3>
        <p>
            When thinking about a proper representative of the Hoodie project on the internet, all of a sudden we ended up in an extensive discussion. Of course we had had a dog as a profile picture in Hoodie’s official internet accounts for a long time, but did that even matter? Everyone of us was completely aware that <strong>the internet is full of cats</strong>, so was it even appropriate to have Hoodie represented by a dog? Or wouldn’t it be far better to hire a cat to do the job, also to gain broader acceptance and support from the general internet audience, which, according to statistics, consists of 95% cats?

        <p>
            Then we stumbled upon a blog post: <em>“Hi, I’m a dog,”</em> it started. We continued reading: <em>“I have been on the internet for more than ten years now. Most of my time on the internet I spent in niches, places which are designed for dogs and other internet animals that are just not cats. I’m aware that the internet is mostly a place for cats, and I’m okay with it. I mean, I like cats. They’re usually quite decent animals, although their huge visibility (they’re just everywhere!) is sometimes a bit frustrating. Still, I think that the internet is also a place for animals like me, and that we should be more visible here. I, as my kind of animals, am not a high-profile animal on the internet yet, but if there’s a place for me where I could get in touch with a broader audience, please contact me. Oh, and by the way: I love wearing textiles.”</em> Touched by those words, we knew it immediately: this dog just had to be our project representative.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is the reason why we now have a dog on all our internet profiles: our beloved Low-Profile Dog.
