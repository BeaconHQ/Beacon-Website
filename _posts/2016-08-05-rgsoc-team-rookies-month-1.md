Hey, we are [Tehetena](https://github.com/titay2) and [HyeSoo](https://github.com/flyjwayur) from team [Rookies](https://twitter.com/hoodierookies). We want to keep our beginner mindset throughout the RGSOC journey, so we made our team name ‘Rookies’. We’re living and working from Helsinki, Finland. We are studying information technology and we love to learn new technologies. We joined the Rails Girls Summer of Code and it has been an amazing experience. 

## Team Rookies and Hoodie project with Rails Girls Summer of Code (RGSOC)

We started working on the Hoodie desktop application project. For making it, we’ve been working on UI/UX for the application and learning how to use Git, Node, localStorage and APIs to implement functionalities. 
[Gregor](https://twitter.com/gr2m) is our project mentor. [Esko](https://twitter.com/orfjackal), [Omid](https://twitter.com/omidfi) and [Musse](https://github.com/mussebekabil) are our coaches, and [Pilar](https://twitter.com/Althaire) is our project supervisor.

## What we’ve achieved so far
When we started the project, we had low self confidence. Even though we have taken classes on different programming languages, when it came to working with it we thought we did not have all the knowledge it took to get the job done. Now we understand that __every working experience is a great opportunity to teach ourselves new things everyday__.

The very first lesson we learned was __Git__. We have done several school projects that we have managed to save and clone project repositories on Git, but after we started working on the Hoodie desktop application, there have been many challenges. At first, we did not know how to propose issues, submit pull requests, fetch from remote, rebase and so on, and we were confused with the concept between local and remote. With our mentor Gregor’s help, and many trials and errors, we now have better understanding of how GitHub actually works, how it is used in our project, and also when many contributors are working on the same project.

Other than using GitHub, we have also learned a lot on __UI building__ and how to implement functionalities on the application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We learned how to use EventListener, event.target, .map, .forEach, and localStorage. Using localStorage and making an API were very interesting. We followed the [tutorials](https://github.com/gr2m/localstorage-tutorial/) made by Gregor. It was very helpful and easy to follow. After practicing the code with tutorials, we had a call to solve the problems together and had a Q&A session. We have a call almost everyday. It’s been really helpful and given us deeper insight on how coding can be applied in the application and how we can use it in the desktop application with the Electron framework.

You can see more stories about team Rookies’ activities from our [blog](https://rookies-2016rgsoc.rhcloud.com/) or check out our [repository](https://github.com/Rookies-RGSOC2016/hoodie-electron-app) creating the Hoodie desktop application.

## Support from a mentor and coaches
Sometimes there were certain problems which took longer time to solve, but working with advanced coaches and mentors taught us different ways to solve them, and most of the time the new approaches were even easier and clearer to understand. The mentors’ and coaches’ guidance helped us experiment on different coding practices we came across online. It also ensured us that there was someone whom we could rely on and ask questions.

## Our next journey and our hope
Lastly, we would like to share some happy news with the Hoodie community. A newborn baby joined our journey! HyeSoo delivered a baby just 3 weeks ago. We hope that the baby will bring happiness to our project and our team. We also hope that we can make a useful Hoodie desktop application for the users. Thank you for welcoming us and providing us a wonderful chance to join Hoodie project!

Happy Summer & happy coding! ;D
