There we go: travelling again! We have already given Hoodie- and Hoodie-related talks at 24 meetups and conferences this year and had a great time there &#8211; it was amazing to meet so many new people and see their interest in Hoodie, and we&#8217;re looking forward to the next events. <3

Especially September will be an even more exciting time for us: it&#8217;s the time of [JSFest Berlin][1], a full week of conferences and events for the community. As many of us are part of the orga teams there (e.g. of [JSConf EU][2], [Reject.JS][3], [CSSConf EU][3] and [up.front][4]), chances are you can meet us there.

If you want to give a Hoodie talk yourself and need slides or support, ping us, we&#8217;re happy to help. There&#8217;s also a [list of all talks][5] (incl. videos, if available) given before.

So, long story short: this is where we&#8217;re going in August and September: <!--more-->
