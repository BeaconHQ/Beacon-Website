We do our best to follow a more regular schedule with our shout out blog posts, but we could use some help. :)
We started [documenting the workflow to create a blog post like this](https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/wiki/How-to-create-a-shout-out-blog-post), it’s about two hours of work right now. If you know JavaScript / Node.js, you can also help us by improving our [github-shoutouts](https://github.com/finnp/github-shoutouts) CLI tool. Please [get in touch](http://hood.ie/contact/).

If you are interested, [there are many ways you can contribute](http://hood.ie/contribute/). <3
