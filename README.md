# Getting started

To get started check out the recent version and type npm install.
The default task (just type 'grunt') will fire up a local server at localhost:1337 with livereload and dev Sass compiling (including sourcemap and nested output).
There's also a production task ('grunt build') which at this point just spits out a compressed CSS file, without sourcemap in a dedicated folder(css/build).
