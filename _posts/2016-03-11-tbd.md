## Open Source

> It’s time to stop treating data center design like Fight Club and demystify the way these things are built.

## Design

> As different perspectives are brought to the table, a greater understanding can be realized. It is important to me as a black designer to look for ways that my unique cultural experience can add value to a project. No one else can tell our stories but us; therefore, we should not discount the advantages that we hold that can change the world.

## The Web and Development

>In just under a decade, changes in China, corporate interest in preparing the “next billion” workforce and a cultural shift in how we compute (small-serving) has taken “making” mainstream. But mostly as a meme. As Make author and editor Alasdair Allan puts it, makers are in a “trough of disillusionment.” It should be “about more than electronics,” he says, “it’s supposed to be a cultural movement.”

>Blogger eventually went to the nice retirement home of Google, and waved to its friend Flickr across the street at Yahoo!. They sat on the verandah enjoying the breezes, while the young’uns like Facebook and Instagram zoomed by on hoverboards.

## The Tech World and Culture

>I tell you the story of how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time in my entire life that I had done something that was truly brave, where I didn’t worry about being perfect.

>What happens when we don’t have a culture of self-criticism? Well, we can probably guess from every single other industry that got too full of itself: We’re on a path where we will no longer be seen as “the good guys” unless we make serious, meaningful changes. (And yeah, we’re especially not gonna be seen as “good guys” if “guys” stay in place as the overwhelmingly dominant force in the industry.)
